      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> Hi there, my name is Salma ... incase that wasn't already obvious. I'm a 60 year old in a 28 year olds body. Mentally I range from anywhere between 15-60. I'm trying to reconcile between wanting to travel the world and being a responsible adult. I have two degrees in politics, that's how much I love it. " It's like chess... but the stakes are higher... and more deadly. Why have I decided to go into coding? Honestly, it's to gain a new skill, because you can never have too many. That and because I like putting myself into situations that im unfamiliar in.

      </p>
