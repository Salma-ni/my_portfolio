# My Portfolio
The creation of my portfolio in the form of a HTML.

## Description

Challange 2 was the creation of my portfilio using HTML and CSS.
We were given a basic starter code and .css and told to recreate the image (with much difficulty).
I created a Nav bar with links to an 'About Me', 'Projects', 'Contact Me' and 'Resume'. 
The resume links to an external webpage, and the rest link to parts of the webpage.

In the About me section - I added some basic info about me with lorem ipsum, as well as a photo with a border.

In the Project section - I added 5 major projects I will be working on (updating them as i go along). The first project is my first Github Repo (with a link to it). The image is bigger than the other 4 projects.

In the contact me section - There are links to contact me on Github, LinkedIn and Email.

I chose purple and black for the theme.

I added a media query to fit other screens as well.

Overall i find that this challange was difficult only because I had done some things wrong and because I am short on time. If I had more time, I'm sure I would be able to find a way to satisfy all the criteria. 

## Usage

The usage is pretty simple as a basic HTML.
